**4. Literature Review**

**4.1 Web-Based Energy Monitoring Systems**

**Research by Al-Ali et al. (2021) highlights the increasing adoption of web-based platforms for real-time energy monitoring in smart homes and buildings. These systems often leverage IoT devices for data acquisition and provide users with interactive dashboards accessible via web browsers. The ability to visualize consumption patterns and receive alerts is a key feature driving user engagement (Kim & Cho, 2022).**

**4.2 User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) in Energy Dashboards**

**Effective UI/UX design is crucial for the success of energy management applications. Studies by Li et al. (2023) emphasize the importance of intuitive navigation, clear data visualization (e.g., charts, graphs, color-coded indicators), and actionable insights. Personalized feedback and gamification elements have also been shown to improve user adoption and promote energy-saving behaviors (Okumus et al., 2020). The ESCOM application incorporates these principles by providing a clean interface, live data updates, and clear visual cues for power usage levels.**

**4.3 Impact of Real-time Feedback and Control**

**Providing users with real-time feedback on their energy consumption, coupled with the ability to control devices remotely, can lead to significant energy savings. A meta-analysis by Fischer (2008) and more recent studies (e.g., Andor & Fels, 2018) confirm that direct feedback mechanisms are more effective than indirect ones (like monthly bills) in encouraging behavioral changes. The ESCOM systemâ€™s live dashboard and device control features are designed to leverage this effect.**

**5. Project Objectives**

**The primary objectives for the ESCOM Power Management Web Application are:**

1.  **Develop a secure and scalable web application for comprehensive energy management, accessible via standard web browsers.**
2.  **Implement robust user authentication and profile management features.**
3.  **Enable users to create and manage an inventory of their household or business electrical devices, including their power consumption ratings.**
4.  **Provide a real-time dashboard displaying current total power consumption, unit balance, and system alerts with dynamic visualizations (e.g., power usage pulse).**
5.  **Allow users to remotely toggle the status (on/off) of their registered devices through an intuitive control panel.**
6.  **Implement a system for managing prepaid electricity units, including purchasing (simulated) and live balance updates.**
7.  **Develop an automated alert system to notify users of critical events such as low unit balance, high consumption spikes, or devices left on for extended periods.**
8.  **Offer a historical data logging and reporting feature, allowing users to track their consumption trends over time (with future enhancements for detailed analytics and comparisons).**
9.  **Design an intuitive and responsive user interface (UI) that ensures a seamless user experience (UX) across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).**
10. **Ensure the application is well-documented, both for end-users (implicitly through UI clarity) and for future development/maintenance.****6. System Specifications**

**6.1 Technical Platform**

**The ESCOM Power Management Web Application is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and related technologies, chosen for its robustness, scalability, and rich ecosystem for web development. Specifically:**

-   **Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework for building RESTful APIs to handle business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.**
-   **Database: SQLite is used for local data persistence, including user accounts, device information, power unit balances, usage history, and alerts. This was chosen for simplicity in this simulation project but can be scaled to MongoDB or other NoSQL/SQL databases in a production environment.**
-   **Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and session management.**

**6.2 Development Environment**

-   **IDE: Visual Studio Code (or similar code editor)**
-   **Version Control: Git with a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)**
-   **Package Management: npm (Node Package Manager) for both frontend and backend dependencies.**
-   **Runtime Environment: Node.js**

**6.3 Application Architecture**

**The application follows a client-server architecture:**

1.  **Presentation Layer (Frontend - React): Handles user interaction, displays data, and sends requests to the backend. Key components include the Landing Page, Dashboard, Device Management, Controls, and User Profile pages.**
2.  **Business Logic Layer (Backend - Node.js/Express.js): Processes requests from the frontend, implements business rules (e.g., usage calculation, alert generation), interacts with the database, and manages user sessions.**
3.  **Data Layer (Backend - SQLite): Stores and retrieves all persistent data for the application.**

**The frontend and backend communicate via a RESTful API.**

**6.4 Target Environment**

-   **Web Browsers: Modern desktop and mobile web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).**
-   **Deployment: The backend server runs on Node.js. The frontend is a static build served by the Node.js server or a dedicated static file server. The application can be deployed locally or on cloud platforms.**

```
*(This is a textual representation. A graphical diagram would be inserted here in a rich document format.)*

**8.1.2. Key Components and Data Flow**

*   **User Interface (React Components):** Pages for Landing, Authentication (Sign Up/Sign In Modals), Dashboard, My Devices, Device Controls, User Profile. These components handle user input, display data, and make API calls to the backend.
*   **State Management (React Context API/useState/useEffect):** Manages application state on the frontend, such as user authentication status, device lists, current power usage, and alerts.
*   **API Client (Frontend):** Uses `fetch` or a library like `axios` (implicitly, as not specified but common) to make HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints.
*   **Backend API Endpoints (Express.js):** Routes for user authentication (`/api/users/signup`, `/api/users/signin`), profile management (`/api/users/profile`), device management (`/api/devices/household-items`, `/api/users/devices`), device control (`/api/users/devices/:userDeviceId/toggle`), power unit management (`/api/users/units`, `/api/users/units/balance`), usage logging (`/api/usage/log`), and alerts (`/api/alerts`).
*   **Business Logic (Backend Services):** Modules within the backend that handle password hashing (bcrypt), JWT generation/verification, database interactions, power consumption calculations (implicitly, based on active devices), and alert generation logic.
*   **Database (SQLite):** Stores user credentials, profile information, user-specific device inventory, device states, power unit balances, usage history, and alerts.

**Data Flow Example (Toggling a Device):**
1.  User clicks a toggle button on the Device Controls page (React frontend).
2.  The React component triggers an API call to the backend (e.g., `PUT /api/users/devices/:userDeviceId/toggle` with the new state).
3.  The Express.js backend receives the request, authenticates the user via JWT.
4.  The backend updates the `is_active` status of the device in the SQLite database for that user.
5.  The backend sends a success response to the frontend.
6.  The frontend updates the UI to reflect the new device state and recalculates/redisplays total power consumption.
7.  The backend may also log this event and generate an alert (e.g., "Device X turned ON").

**8.2 Core Components Design**

**8.2.1 Database Schema (SQLite)**

**The SQLite database includes the following key tables:**

*   **`users` Table:**
    *   `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)
    *   `email` (TEXT, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
    *   `password_hash` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
    *   `full_name` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
    *   `address` (TEXT)
    *   `phone` (TEXT)
    *   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    *   `last_login` (TIMESTAMP)

*   **`user_devices` Table:**
    *   `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)
    *   `user_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY to `users.id`)
    *   `device_id` (TEXT, NOT NULL) - Refers to an ID from `household_items.json`
    *   `quantity` (INTEGER, DEFAULT 1)
    *   `is_active` (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT FALSE)
    *   `custom_name` (TEXT) - User-defined name for the device instance

*   **`power_units` Table:**
    *   `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)
    *   `user_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY to `users.id`)
    *   `units_amount` (FLOAT, NOT NULL) - Amount of units purchased/added
    *   `purchase_date` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    *   *(Implicitly, a separate mechanism or calculation determines current balance by summing purchases and subtracting consumption. The `units_consumed` in `usage_history` can contribute to this.)*

*   **`usage_history` Table:**
    *   `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)
    *   `user_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY to `users.id`)
    *   `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    *   `device_id` (TEXT, NOT NULL) - Which specific device instance (could be `user_devices.id` or a combination)
    *   `duration_minutes` (INTEGER, NOT NULL) - How long it was active for this log entry
    *   `units_consumed` (FLOAT, NOT NULL) - Units consumed in this period
    *   *(This table is simplified; a more robust system might log device state changes and calculate consumption based on those.)*

*   **`alerts` Table:**
    *   `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)
    *   `user_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY to `users.id`)
    *   `alert_type` (TEXT, NOT NULL) - e.g., "low_balance", "high_usage", "device_on"
    *   `message` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
    *   `is_read` (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT FALSE)
    *   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

*   **Static Data (`household_items.json` - Served by backend):**
    *   Contains an array of predefined household items, each with:
        *   `id` (TEXT, UNIQUE)
        *   `name` (TEXT)
        *   `category` (TEXT)
        *   `power_consumption` (FLOAT, kWh/hour)
        *   `icon` (TEXT) - e.g., Font Awesome class name
        *   `default_schedule` (OBJECT, Optional) - For smart scheduling defaults

**8.2.2 Key Algorithms/Logic**

*   **Total Power Consumption Calculation:** Sum of (`power_consumption` * `quantity`) for all `user_devices` where `is_active` is true. This is recalculated whenever a device state changes or quantities are updated.
*   **Unit Balance Reduction:** A backend process (or frontend simulation for live effect) periodically deducts units based on total active power consumption. `Units_Deducted = Total_Power_Consumption_kW * (Interval_Seconds / 3600)`.
*   **Alert Generation:** Triggered by events:
    *   Device toggle: Log and create "device_on" / "device_off" alert.
    *   Unit balance check: If balance falls below a user-defined or system threshold (e.g., estimated 2 days remaining), generate "low_balance" alert.
    *   Unusual consumption: If instantaneous total usage exceeds a dynamic threshold (e.g., 2x average daily peak for that user) or a specific device runs for an unusually long time, generate "high_usage" or "device_left_on" alert.

**8.2.3 User Interface Flow (Key Pages)**

1.  **Landing Page (`/`)**
    *   Displays application branding, value proposition, testimonials.
    *   Buttons for "Sign Up" and "Sign In" which open respective modals.
    *   Screenshot: `![Landing Page](documentation_assets/screenshots/landing_page.png)`

2.  **Authentication Modals (Pop-ups on Landing Page)**

**9. Success Criteria**

**The success of the ESCOM Power Management Web Application will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

**9.1 Technical Performance**

-   **Accuracy of Power Monitoring: Real-time power usage displayed on the dashboard accurately reflects the sum of active devices' consumption within a small margin of error (e.g., +/- 5%).**
-   **Responsiveness of Controls: Device toggle commands from the control panel are reflected in the system and UI within 1-2 seconds.**
-   **Live Data Updates: Unit balance and total power usage on the dashboard update at the specified intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds for unit balance) without significant lag.**
-   **Alert Timeliness: Alerts for low balance, high usage, or device status changes are generated and displayed promptly (within 5-10 seconds of the triggering event).**
